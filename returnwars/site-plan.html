			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose is to setup a kind of blog that will share short stories from my Return Wars universe. I want to allow people to read the stories that they want and to explore and enjoy my fictional universe.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My audience is mainly readers, but also includes fans of general sci-fi. The audience would be attracted to the site since the short stories would be free to access.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I want there to be a filter for the short stories, like filtering for which factions you want to read about. I also want to enable a light mode and a dark mode. The home page will also have some random short stories for display each day. I lastly want there to be a recommended next reading that looks at the story just read to recommend more short stories for the user.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
